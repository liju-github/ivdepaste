1- I tried to use Redux to store the current theme even after a reload, but I forgot that Redux resets during a reload.
2- I wasted time trying to figure out why the Chrome browser didn't store routes (stateless). The reason behind this was that I had enabled preloading in Chrome, which forces the browser to prefetch the page when itâ€™s not in focus.
3- I fixed several issues regarding the theme provider by Shadcn, removed all the unnecessary mount checks I used to avoid Hydration errors, and switched to client-side rendering (CSR).
